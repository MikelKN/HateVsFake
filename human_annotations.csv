"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There has been no evidence of widespread election fraud in the Nov. 8 presidential contest, the White House said on Monday in reaction to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s tweet over the weekend alleging millions of illegal votes and fraud in three states.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest, speaking to reporters at a daily briefing, deferred comments on Trump’s specific tweets to the president-elect’s team, but added: “What I can say, as an objective fact, is that there has been no evidence produced to substantiate a claim like that.” ",0 (Neutral),0 (Neutral),1 (Mild),0 (Neutral),0
"October 28, 2016 Let’s Be Clear—A Vote for Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is a Vote for World War 3 
If you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. 
It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as “dangerous” and “temperamental” because it is Clinton who actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades. 
Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election, I am fully convinced that World War III will begin before her time in the White House is over. 
Someone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters, Trump recently stated that we are “going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton”:",3 (Hostile),3 (Hostile),3 (Hostile),4 (Hateful),3

Throughout this election, Hillary Clinton has been claiming to be a “warrior for women” who will do everything in her power to help victims of sexual assault. That’s why it came as bad news to her when the video above this story surfaced… 
Infowars reported that the video shows child rape victim Kathy Shelton explain how Clinton allowed her rapist to go free when she was his defense lawyer, even thought she knew he was guilty. Afterwards, Clinton was caught on a recording laughing about the fact that she’d just knowingly set a child rapist free. 
“He took a lie detector test,” Clinton said on the recording, according to The American Thinker. “I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs (laughs).”

"Never let an opportunity go to waste. Its the Democrat mantra Whenever a black person dies, no matter what the circumstances, the first and most important question is: How can Al Sharpton turn this into dollars? With the death of funk/pop icon Prince yesterday, you re probably thinking there is no way the race-hustling Reverend can turn the tragedy into social justice (AKA cold hard cash) but you re underestimating his awesome powers of exploitation.The Amsterdam News reports that Al Sharpton will be holding a rally on Saturday at the National Action Network s House of Justice in New York. I m not kidding, he really has a place he calls the  House of Justice.  The original purpose of this rally was to protest the police shooting a black guy who pointed a gun at officers, but with Prince s untimely death, Sharpton has decided to combine faux outrage with a faux tribute.Here s the black guy who was  wronged  by a racist system:Tillman was fatally shot by NYPD officers on Sunday in Ozone Park, Queens. Reports indicate that he was allegedly holding an open alcohol container when officers approached him. Tillman had a gun on his waistband and allegedly ran as they approached him. Police say he reached for the weapon before officers opened fire shooting Tillman in the chest. He was pronounced dead at Jamaica Medical Center.Let s see if I have this correctly: A black guy was carrying an illegal firearm in NYC and violating the city s drinking in public law. When police tried to question him, he resisted arrest and took off. He then took out the illegal firearm and pointed it at officers and they responded by shooting him. In other words, police used appropriate force to deal with a violent life-threatening situation. How exactly is this a case of racial injustice? Oh, because the guy was black. I get it now.I guess it s getting harder and harder for Sharpton to find any real racism to rage against, so he has to work with what he s got.Just in case people have a hard time freaking out over a justified police shooting, Big Al is throwing in a tribute to Prince to get asses in the seats:As the aftermath of the death of singer Prince continues, Sharpton will conduct a special memorial in honor of the legendary entertainer and humanitarian.I wasn t aware there was  aftermath  from Prince s death, but it sure does seem like a shitty tribute to combine this with some bogus racial outrage over a guy who got shot for trying to kill some cops.Really the only question left is: how will Sharpton blame Prince s death on white supremacy? Was there a white conspiracy to kill the singer? Did he die because white EMTs responded slower than they would have if Prince were white? Did a white man give him the flu and force him to take opioids?Via: DownTrend ",0 (Neutral),3 (Hostile),3 (Hostile),1 (Mild),4

"SWEDEN HELP WANTED: Activities Coordinator for bored illegal alien Muslim freeloaders and rapists Muslim illegal alien invaders taking up space in Sweden and living off the government dole, say they are vandalizing and burning cars (not to mention gang-raping Swedish girls) because they do not have enough “activities” to keep them busy. Friatider “It is clear as hell that we take out our frustration by destroying and vandalizing when we have a shortage of activities here,” one of the illegals living in Skallberget in Vasteras writes in a letter to the editor in the local newspaper VLT. Vasteras has recently been subjected to a long series of car fires. The submitter tries the young man, who wishes to remain anonymous, explain what the phenomenon is due. He writes that he came to Sweden when he was young and admittedly had “good potential” but that he was subject to persistent “racism” by the authorities. (What “race” is Islam?) “Already at an early age became a man treated differently. Sometimes it was because of ethnicity, sometimes because they were at a certain place, and sometimes just to those very people who were in power felt to fuck with us. So many times I had been propped up against the wall and strip-searched in front of my loved ones. It really depressed me and my value, “he writes. The man writes that the young people in the area feel “oppressed” and that they are burning cars to “get the environment to react and listen.” Among other things, he complains that the objectives of the local football field does not have a network and that it is not organized enough “activities” for young people. “In short, it is clear as hell that we take out our frustration by destroying and vandalizing when we have a shortage of activities here. There is neither good fellowship, activities and things / objects we can make use of.” Submitters have received several responses from readers who are critical of the reasoning. “It’s just a matter of time before someone of obtained or ‘the others’ die if this continues. No pity you – all just hate you more and more,” writes , for example, the signature “Former car owners on Skallberget”.

"The   Islamic state magazine Rumiyah has called on supporters and Islamic State fighters in Germany and Austria to murder moderate Imams who they consider  “apostates. ”[The magazine was released in several languages earlier this week through the various internet channels Islamic State uses to broadcast propaganda to its sympathisers, MEMRI reports. One of the methods used was a “telegram” app, an encrypted messaging service that ISIS often uses and is generally the first place the group takes credit for terror attacks.  The terror group named several prominent members of the Muslim community in both Germany and Austria as potential targets for assassination in an article entitled “Kill the infidel imams in Germany and Austria. ” Among the targets listed is Aiman Mazyek,   of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. Mazyek has made controversial statements in the past, such as calling for German leaders to limit the number of migrants flowing into the country in late 2015. The Muslim leader has also slammed the   migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) likening them to Nazis after they revealed a platform of   last year. Omar   a Vienna city councilman for the Socialist Party (SPÖ) and a member of the Council Committee on European and International Affairs was also listed as a target.   is also no stranger to controversy  —   in 2010 he led an official condemnation of Israel in the Vienna city hall over the Israeli raids on a flotilla heading for Gaza, which Israeli authorities claimed was not the  humanitarian mission activists stated it to be.   also led a protest against Israel in Vienna. Among the demonstrators were members of the Turkish   nationalist group the Grey Wolves who have clashed with Kurds in Germany and have been accused of trying to infiltrate German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party through its diversity program. Killing Imams they don’t agree with is nothing new for the Islamic State. In 2014 ISIS executed 13 clerics in the city of Mosul whom they deemed to be too moderate. Imam Muhammad al Mansuri was one of the victims of the terror group and was the imam in charge of the mosque in which ISIS leader     gave a rare public appearance to lead prayers. Islamic State killed a further six imams in early 2015 after they condemned the group’s actions when they burned Jordanian pilot Mu’ath Kasasbeh alive.

"175 Views Share: Commentary — Seriously, you always hear that we mustn’t deport people because it could break up families. Yet we are encouraging teenagers to run away from their families and try their luck on America’s streets! Latino Invasion Set for New Record 
The New Observer March 2, 2016 
More than 17,000 “unaccompanied alien minors” had invaded the US over the Mexican border in the past few months, and the number of “family units” has increased to 21,000, the US House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security has been informed. 
The House was also told that if the present trends continue, there will be a 30 percent increase on the record number of 260,000 invaders who entered the US in 2014. 


“In the past few months the number of unaccompanied alien minors unlawfully entering the US soared to over 17,000 and the number of family units increased to 21,000,” Chair Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) informed the US House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security in a February 4 hearing on Capitol Hill. 
“If these trends continue it is predicted there will be a 30 percent increase in the record high numbers we witnessed in 2014.” 
The widespread criminal violence endemic in the nonwhite Third World countries to the south continues to be a major factor in the ongoing invasion, Omar Zamora, public affairs officer for the US Border Patrol Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector told the local KVUE TV station. 
“We’ve got gangs over there that are controlling the neighborhoods, controlling the cities,” Zamora said. 
Agents of the RRGV Sector, he said, “man the front lines of the battle against drug trafficking and human smuggling.” 
The US government has mounted an ad campaign along the Guatemala–Honduras border warning would-be invaders what to expect from human traffickers. 
According to Zamora, the human traffickers engage in everything from child molestation and rape to extortion and fraud. READ Cologne Police Officer Confirms: It was “Refugees” 
“I think the biggest misconceptions are, ‘Hey they’re just children down there, right? It’s a humanitarian crisis,’” said Zamora, “But what I want to stress is there’s the 50 percent of the other individuals that are running, that are fighting, that have criminal records.” 
Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), who chairs the House Border Security Caucus, told KVUE that “If people figure they have a 95 percent chance of being allowed to stay and work and get government benefits, they’re going to come no matter what they might hear on the street or on the radio or see in a leaflet.” 
In a February 23 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) asked agency Acting Chief Ronald Vitiello whether giving undocumented immigrants the impression they won’t be allowed to stay in the US without a legal claim would act as a deterrent and slow the flow of unauthorized crossings. 
“Yes, I believe that matters,” Vitiello answered.",1 (Mild),3 (Hostile),3 (Hostile),1 (Mild),4

Say goodbye to Sweden A local family in the Swedish city of Liding  has been ordered by the government to leave their home so that it can be given to migrants arriving from a foreign country.Father of two teenage boys Uffe Rustan received a voicemail from his local municipality telling him he would need to vacate the property by August in order to make way for asylum seekers from the Middle East.  I was evicted from my home over the phone. When I asked for the reason, he said that people come from other countries.

Rustan said that the news was  depressing  and wondered why native Swedes were being treated worse than migrants arriving in the country for the first time. Despite suffering from a housing shortage, Sweden is handing over property to economic migrants, with some politicians even encouraging citizens to give up their garages to asylum seekers. Sweden is not the only European government that is turfing its own citizens out of social housing to accommodate the influx of Muslim migrants. While migrants are in some cases enjoying all the comforts of good quality hotels, low income Germans are being ordered to leave their homes.

Scroll Down For Video Below! So let’s start off with a little fact from Wikipedia. Back in 2010, just in time to help Obama get elected again, Dominion Voting Machines bought out the right to own the machines in 22 different states.

The same company has also been caught red-handed donating enough money to the Clinton Foundation to make it to the top of their online donor list. Just take a look at the Clinton Foundation’s website itself.

Wow. That is just such a strange coincidence, don’t you think? Right around the same time Hillary Clinton was deciding to retire as Secretary of State and focus on her campaign, this company bought out half the voting machines in the country.
And if that is not bad enough, one of the top owners of Dominion Voting is none other than the king of corruption himself, George Soros. So if you think this is as important of information as I do, then share this out immediately! Time is of the essence…

When confronted with a question on the Project Veritas undercover videos showing all kinds of Dem operatives admitting on tape that they created the Trump protests and other such nasties to incite violence at Trump rallies in an attempt to throw this election Hillary’s way, Earnest told the reporter in his best condescending grown up voice that ‘we have to take these videos with not just a grain of salt but a whole bag because we can’t believe what we see…’ 
Watch for yourself. 
Don’t believe your own eyeballs. That’s the White House’s official response. That’s the best they could do. 
Again, it’s undercover video he’s talking about here. Not only that, but Robert Creamer did go to the White House over 340 times . It’s all on record.

"This is just another example of how public schools are using a globalist approach to indoctrinate our children. Watering down the greatness of America by blurring our border lines that so many brave men fought to preserve is repulsive. Fighting back against this mentality in our PUBLIC schools should be a priority for every parent and grandparent in America!It is widely accepted that American public schools are controlled by liberals. It seems like every day, we see new examples of American schoolchildren being indoctrinated with left-wing ideas.This latest example was brought to our attention by a concerned parent.Kindergarten students from PS75, a public school in New York City, recently took part in a class project in which the children were made to create an American flag with the flags of other 22 other nations superimposed over the stripes. Below the flag read the words  We pledge allegiance to an International Flag. Check out the flag the kindergarten class created:This is the type of globalist indoctrination we have come to expect from the public school system, but telling impressionably young American children that their loyalty should lie with some nebulous idea of a global community rather than their own nation is a new low.Read more:Hannity.com",1 (Mild),2 (Disrespect),3 (Hostile),1 (Mild),3

This woman pulls the race card when confronted with her crime?Just in case you haven t heard of Sarsour:Approximately 200,000 people participated in a  Women s March  in D.C. on Saturday. One of the organizers of the march, Linda Sarsour is a Pro-Palestine Muslim activist.She also advocates for Sharia Law in America and has ties to terrorist organization, Hamas.Linda Sarsour, one of the organizers behind Saturday s Women s March, being held in Washington, D.C., was recently spotted at a large Muslim convention in Chicago posing for pictures with an accused financier for Hamas, the terrorist group.Sarsour, the head of the Arab American Association of New York and an Obama White House  Champion of Change,  was speaking at last month s 15th annual convention of the Muslim American Society and Islamic Circle of North America.While there, she posed for a picture with Salah Sarsour, a member of the Islamic Society of Milwaukee and former Hamas operative who was jailed in Israel in the 1990s because of his alleged work for the terrorist group.Though she avoids discussing it now, Sarsour has acknowledged in past interviews that she has cousins serving prison time in Israel because of their work for Hamas.Sarsour has denied having any contact with the terror group. She told The New York Times in 2012 that she would not have been appointed an Obama  Champion of Change  if she had.The activist has risen to national attention recently. She served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, and she is one of four lead organizers for the Women s March.  Daily CallerThe fact that an Islamic faction was one of the organizers of the Women s March is laughable at best. Islam is responsible for the worst abuses of women and children not only throughout history, but at present day.

"Mark Levin lays out Obama s one-sided, unconstitutional Iran nuke deal in this easy to understand video. In the video below, he points out the danger we, as a nation face with this reckless  President  and the cowardly Republican majority Congress who refuses to stand up to him and his radical transformation of America Obama is patting himself on the back for making what he seems to think is a great deal with our long time enemy Iran. The truth is, this deal does nothing for America and it does everything to help Iran get a nuclear bomb. The goal of this deal was to dismantle Iran s nuclear program completely, it doesn t do that. On that point alone, it s a failed deal. This deal allows Iran to continue enriching uranium, and it drops the sanctions that have been working well until this point.Also, if the U.S decides to do a  surprise  inspection, we have to give them 24 days notice! So what do we get out of this historic deal? Nothing. We get an enemy with more money and more power to build a bomb.As Mark Levin points out in this video, Obama just planted the seeds for World War III. This president has done nothing but help our enemies, and he should be convicted of treason for it. There is a reason Iranians are cheering, it s because they know that America just bowed to them.

"*Sent:* Tuesday, August 11, 2015 6:00 PM *To:* Kendall, David *Subject:* Hi again from AP (inquiry about thumb drive) Hi David, We have been told, and we are preparing to report, that the FBI has taken possession of the thumb drive that was once in your possession. This is what we have been informed, and we wanted to see whether there was any sort of comment that could be provided. If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well . But we have solid reason to believe this. We’d welcome any comment you can offer. Thanks very much. Eric Associated Press reporter says he knows it’s true, but will gladly print that it’s false 
What’s truly astonishing in this email is how AP reporter Eric Tucker says he will gladly LIE to cover for the Clintons . In plain English, he explains that he has “solid reason” to believe the report about the thumb drive, but he will gladly publish a false narrative via the Associated Press , and he even suggests what that false narrative should be: “If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well.” 
In other words, he’s not just corrupt, dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist, he’s also SUGGESTING the false narrative the Clintons should use! 
This is the exact same way the AP talks to the CDC about vaccines and measles, by the way. Essentially, the Associated Press reporters say, “We are total media whores, we will bend over and grab our ankles while you shove your fake story down the throats of our readers who foolishly think we’re a credible news organization.” 
You gotta love Eric Tucker for this. The guy takes the prize for finally spelling out in black and white what we’ve known for years: the AP is a total joke when it comes to real journalism . Note carefully that the AP won’t even fire Tucker for this admission. He’ll probably get a prize of some sort. How many other Associated Presstitutes have deliberately LIED to cover up Clinton crimes? 
It all brings to mind the obvious question: How many other Associated Presstitutes deliberately lied to cover up Clinton crimes? 
Just what percentage of AP stories about the Clinton scandals are actually FAKE NEWS pretending to be credible journalism? (Answer: Probably about 99%.)

Stephens said the weapon appeared to be either a BB gun or an air rifle.Someone from Stephens  campaign headquarters followed the vehicle, helping police to locate and apprehend the suspects.Five people have been detained in connection with the incident.During an interview with KFDM, Stephens referred to the attack  an example of ignorance.

Hillary Clinton thought if there was one person in the world that she could trust, it was her “friend” Huma Abedin.

"Muslims Terrorize Hindus Because It's Wednesday November 4, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
The official media narrative is that Muslims are the world's greatest victims. The truth, especially in majority Muslim countries, is rather strikingly different . 
Crowds of Muslims attacked Hindu homes and temples in eastern Bangladesh this week, raising concerns that the authorities are not taking steps to curb rising religious tensions. 
Attacks on Hindus are not unusual in Bangladesh, but it is rare to see multiple crowds targeting temples in an organized way as they did on Sunday and Monday. 
Note the casual language of the Times. Muslim religious violence is commonplace in Bangladesh. It's just not common for it to be happening on this scale. 
But how could it be otherwise? Islam is structurally xenophobic, violently bigoted and racist down to its origins. Islam's faith is expressed in a violent campaign against non-Muslims. This is Jihad. 
Muslims attacking Hindus, Christians, Jews, Yazidis or any other group? That just means it must be Wednesday. Or any other day of the week. 
On Sunday, hundreds of Muslims entered a Hindu neighborhood, where they ransacked 15 temples and the homes of more than 100 families, Mr. Deb said. He said that the mob “used long, hard sticks and locally made sharp weapons” to assault Hindus they found there, and that at least 20 people, including a priest, were wounded.

If you live in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area, please go and protest this float.The Islamic hate group CAIR is taunting our veterans and military personnel with this latest stunt. Yesterday, veterans gathered at the Richard L. Jones, Jr. Airport to protest the terror-tied float.

CAIR was founded in 1994 in Washington, D.C., as a national organization to be a civil rights advocate for American Muslims, to stand up for constitutional rights, for religious freedom, for pluralism, and for every right that we value as American citizens. A Memorial Day Tweet From CAIR, Michigan Director And Retweeted by the San Francisco CAIR Director:Soltani s words are far from the truth. The reality is that  CAIR is an unindicted co-conspirator in a Hamas terror funding case   so named by the Justice Department. CAIR operatives have repeatedly refusedtodenounce Hamas and Hizballah as terrorist groups. Several former CAIR officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror. CAIR s cofounder and longtime Board chairman (Omar Ahmad), as well as its chief spokesman (Ibrahim Hooper), have made Islamic supremacist statements. Its California chapter distributed a poster telling Muslims not to talk to the FBI. CAIR has opposed every anti-terror measure that has ever been proposed or implemented. According to a captured internal document entered into evidence in the largest terrorist funding trial in our nation s history, the Islamic Association of Palestine, which is the parent organization of Hamas-tied CAIR, was a Muslim Brotherhood entity, working toward  eliminating and destroying Western civilization from within, and sabotaging its miserable house   CAIR operatives attack and dismantle America s greatest freedoms through litigation jihad.

"Republican nominee Donald Trump recently surprised everyone when he flip-flopped on the harsh immigration policy he d been promising his racist, hateful supporters since the beginning of his campaign. It turns out, not everyone is taking this news very well   especially the Trump lovers who wanted nothing more than to see millions of illegal immigrants heartlessly removed from the country they built their lives in.On Wednesday s segment of The Glenn Beck Program, a furious Trump supporter shared his reaction to Trump s recent softening on immigration   and it wasn t good. In speaking to host Glenn Beck,  Nate from Virginia  actually delivered a threat to Trump. The guest warned: As long as he does the basic things, the foundational things, which is build a wall, he s not going to have people like me coming after him. Beck wasn t alarmed at first, but was visibly stunned as angry Nate continued his rant. Seemingly speaking for all Trump supporters, Nate said: Oh, he s in so much trouble. You don t even understand the backlash of us, the ones who are so frustrated and angry and tired of all the political stuff. We re going to come after him, personally, you know what I mean? We re going to get him. Beck clarified,  I don t know what you mean. Hang on, what does that mean? Nate s response was far from comforting: You know, the most peaceful way you can get rid of a president When Beck hopefully suggested that Nate might have meant he wants to impeach Trump, Nate corrected him and said he definitely meant violence: Well, I mean, hey, you yourself said he s condoned violence in the past, hasn t he? He s appealing to people who are very frustrated and angry. Their frustration and anger can only be subsided if he makes his promises true. And he has a lot on his shoulders, maybe he himself doesn t even know how much. But if he doesn t come through for us, he s going to have bigger problems, bigger problems than what you know. Beck was so disturbed by  one of the spookiest phone calls I ve ever received  that he hung up on Nate.You can watch the call unfold below:A few weeks ago, Donald Trump had suggested that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton should be assassinated by the  Second Amendment people.

"Troops Brag of Having Shot Some Fleeing Mosul by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
While UN officials claim they’re carefully monitoring the treatment of those displaced from Mosul and haven’t documented any abuses, the troops occupying checkpoints through which the civilians have to flee are telling a different story, involving mass detentions and summary execution. 
The Associated Press quoted one of those manning a checkpoint, named Dhia Amir, as having bragged of not only “arresting” over 100 people, handing them over to police forces, but of having personally shot and killed two men who he claims to have “known” were fleeing ISIS fighters. 
This has been a recurring problem in Iraq’s wars against ISIS, as Shi’ite dominated security forces and allied militias are immediately distrustful of Sunni Arabs fleeing the ISIS cities, and don’t need much pretext for a detention, or to disappear people outright. 
“A 13-year-old boy can still kill,” Amir noted, defending the crackdown on fleeing civilians. “And even if he doesn’t kill me, one day he could kill my son.” That, ultimately, has been the basis on which much of the war has been fought, and the main reason why sectarian tensions are only growing.

"Assimilate or go hungry  Human rights lawyers descend in 5 4 3 2 1 COPENHAGEN, Denmark   A Danish city has ordered pork to be mandatory on municipal menus, including for schools and daycare centers, with politicians insisting the move is necessary for preserving the country s food traditions and is not an attack on Muslims.Frank Noergaard, a member of the council in Randers that narrowly approved the decision earlier this week, says it was made to ensure that pork remains  a central part of Denmark s food culture. Denmark is a major pork producer and it is the most popular meat, but it is forbidden to Muslims and Jews. Most of the asylum-seekers who have arrived in the country in the past months are Muslim.Noergaard, a member of the anti-immigration, populist Danish People s Party that proposed the council motion, said Thursday that it wasn t meant as a  harassment of Muslims,  but added that he had received  several complaints about too many concessions  being made to Muslims in the small, predominantly Lutheran country. The signal we want to send here is that if you re a Muslim and you plan to come to Randers, don t expect you can impose eating habits on others. Pork here is on an equal footing with other food,  Noergaard told The Associated Press. He said that halal meat, vegetarian dishes and diets for diabetics would still be available.In 2013, then-Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt lashed out at some nurseries after they started serving halal-butchered meat instead of pork because Muslim children had refused to eat it.

"Since sexual harassment is almost a sport at Fox News, it is unsurprising that a man who worked as a Miami correspondent for the network until fairly recently was just arrested for raping someone.Orlando Salinas, who worked for the network from 2000-2012 until he was hired by a CBS affiliate in Roanoke, Virginia, was arrested Tuesday and charged with forcible sodomy and rape. Due to the horrific nature of the allegations, the victim s identity is being shielded but reports specify that the accuser is not his wife or a relative.Salinas, whose prior criminal record includes contributing and three counts of larceny, faces five years to life for each of his felony charges.Salinas was an employee of WDBJ7 from 2012-2015, but was terminated last April for  insubordination.  Since then, he has been working as a real estate agent in the New River Valley. In a  whatever happened to  article published by the Roanoke Times in December, Salinas  current employer called him a  wonderful person  and said that  people who know who he is really trust him.  The judge, however, apparently doesn t really know him because he is being held without bail for the horrific crimes.Salinas told the Times that his firing was the result of a refusal to  tone down  his aggressive interview style, an idea with which he disagreed because he seeks  truth like a missile.

The sword exited the victim s back after being plunged into his chest. Jackson, an army veteran from Baltimore, held a long-time hatred of black people and had traveled to Manhattan with the goal of killing black men.This is an attack you won t see amateur president Donald Trump tweeting about.Timothy Caughman, 66, the white supremacist s victim, stumbled into a police station bleeding from stab wounds to his chest and back, Assistant Chief William Aubry, the commander of Manhattan South detectives, told reporters at Police Headquarters, according to the New York Times.After taking down his first victim, Jackson set his sights on another black person just blocks away but something reportedly  spooked him. He appeared to be very close, following a black guy,  a source said.  He slows down and at one point he turned around and came back. It s clear he was really focused on the guy for some time. Then, he falls out of camera view and doesn t attack the guy. He made statements that he was following the guy but something spooked him. Jackson was arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, but the chief said they wanted to upgrade the charge by classifying it a hate crime.Watch:.@NYPDMTS walk James Harris Jackson, an army veteran & member of a hate group in Maryland, accused of killing a #NYC black man @NYDNVideo pic.twitter.com/DWwGxM0GgG  Edgar Sandoval (@edjsandoval) March 22, 2017Surveillance video of Jackson near the scene:Jackson admitted to police that he was a member of a white supremacist group and said that he detailed his racist views on his laptop computer, according to the Daily News.Jackson told the authorities that he initially wanted to stab a black man, then grab a police officer s gun and  shoot some people,  a police source said.Aubry said,  He wanted to make a statement.

"Facebook Caught Selling Targeted Advertisement Which Excludes Different Races 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 29, 2016 ""This is massively illegal,"" said one lawyer when shown Facebook's ad targeting system allows excluision by race. https://t.co/bCn8fLT529 pic.twitter.com/i62jKP5b8W 
This is so, so funny. 
The top SJW kike himself, Mark Zuckerberg, has been caught using logical means to sell advertisements. 
But logic, we goyim have been told, is pure hatred. 
No idea why they thought they could get away with this. 
RT : 
A scandal is brewing over the discovery that advertisers on Facebook can ânarrowâ their audience by race and ethnicity, allowing them to remove their ads from the feeds of selected demographics, including African American, Asian and Hispanic. 
Micro-targeting, which assigns an ethnicity to users based on their page activity, is designed by Facebook to be used to target niche audiences, but it also allows for exclusion. Facebook claims advertisers are prohibited from abusing the tool, such as using it to discriminate. 
An ad purchased by ProPublica gave them the option to remove certain ethnic groups from viewing a housing ad. 
âThis is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find,â civil rights lawyer John Relman told the publication. 
Facebook responded to ProPublicaâs report saying they believed, âmulticultural advertising should be a tool for empowerment,â adding that they expect advertisers to use the service in compliance with the law. 
âWhen World Cup 2014 became a big focus throughout the US Hispanic community, a business developed a campaign to reach people who had shown interest in that community in order to create a positive association between its brand and the worldâs most popular sport. This meant more relevant ads to those audiences about the World Cup,” the social media giant said, pointing out an example of micro-targeting being used successfully. 
Facebook also said that ads in different languages were another example of the feature being useful for its clients. 
It was a clever troll. 
I am in awe. 
I of course don’t think this should be illegal – it is absolutely nonsensical to make it illegal to prefer certain races over another in any context. Even if you believe “race doesn’t exist,” the fact remains that the different races statistically act very differently from each other, so very much can be determined about a person by knowing their race. 
But it is so funny to see the SJW Jew Zuckerberg caught in his own Jew web of nonsensical gibberish.",2 (Disrespect),2 (Disrespect),2 (Disrespect),1 (Mild),4

Islam and sex slavery are like peanut butter and jelly - you always find the one next to the other. Muslims kidnapping vulnerable white girls in the UK and forcing them to be sex slaves has reached an epidemic level, according to a recent report from the UK Charity Barnados. They say that Muslims are setting up fake businesses, primarily car washes, when, in reality, they are brothels and transit houses for these kidnapped girls: 
Barnardo’s claims girls are being ferried from one unit to another as sex slaves for Kurds[s]. 
It suggests white British girls on the run from the care system in Hartlepool, Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough are being targeted. 
The report said: “There were connections between people that work in car washes and the sexual exploitation of children on Teesside. 
… 
Officers on the immigration-led operation found beds at one. It was suggested staff were living on the premises. 
Cleveland Police said: “It was not confirmed that child sexual exploitation had taken place although enquiries were conducted.” ( source ) 
This is a sad and sickening picture of what the UK has become. Once one of the safest places in the West, it has allowed itself to become little more than a third-world cesspool, where its own women are being sold like slaves in the Muslim bazaars of old, and the government refuses to do its job to stop it, instead allowing it to continue and trying to stop those who want to put a stop to it.

"A federal lawsuit filed against officials at Dietrich High School, located in Dietrich, Idaho, claims that coaches and other staff at the school contributed to an environment of racist bullying, which culminated in the vicious rape of a Black teen by three white students.As KBOI reports here, 17-year-old Tanner Ward and 18-year-old John Howard, along with a third student who was not named, are facing felony sexual assault charges, after authorities say they carried out a vicious sexual assault on a disabled student.The three white students used a coat hanger to rape their Black classmate in the school locker room, last October.According to New York Daily News:A witness testified that Ward initiated the heartless attack and that Howard was the one who kicked the coat hanger five or six times while it was jammed inside the boy s rectum, causing painful injuries that required hospital treatment.The victim, who testified for the first time about the rape last month, told the court that he remembers the three students laughing throughout the brutal assault.According to the suit, coaches and other school officials created an atmosphere in which racist bullying of the mentally disabled teen was not only tolerated but encouraged.The suit alleges that football coaches urged other students, including Howard, to beat-up on the teen, claiming that it would  toughen him up. KBOI reports that the victim was made to wear boxing gloves, while Howard was encouraged to fight him bare-handed.During the incident, other students and coaches surrounded the Black teen, shouting racial slurs at him. The  nighttime fight,  as it was referred to by coaches and students, ended when the disabled teen was knocked unconscious by Howard.This is just one of many instances of racist bullying described in the suit, which states that the victim  was taunted and called racist names by other members of the team which names include  Kool-Aid   chicken eater   watermelon  and n r,  over the course of several months.According to New York Daily News:Howard, who is portrayed in court documents as the ringleader in the merciless harassment, is accused of forcing the black boy to sing a Ku Klux Klan song he learned in Texas, called  Notorious KKK.  Howard also encouraged other football players to join in on the vicious bullying, the suit alleges.The suit, which seeks $10 million in damages, alleges that coaches and school officials knew what was happening, but failed in their duty to protect the disabled student.As KTVB reports in the video below, since filing the suit the victim s family has experienced harassment from some local residents. The school was placed on lockdown on Wednesday, after news of the story broke nationally.Here s more on the story from KTVB.Image credit: video screen capture KTVB",0 (Neutral),4 (Hateful),4 (Hateful),,4

While the idiot presstitutes and their brainwashed victims hyper-ventilate about Trump’s lewd talk about women, one consequence of the ignored nuclear arms race restarted by the neoconservatives, who have been in charge of US foreign policy in the 21st century, is the Russian Satan 2, which is reported to be capable of destroying the entirety of a land mass the size of Texas or France with one hit. 
The neoconservative foreign policy that has produced this result is obviously a total failure and endangers all life on earth. Hillary Clinton is a representative of this disastrous foreign policy. If Americans and Europeans cannot put into office people who can get along with Russia, there is no future for anyone. Trump is the only one who says he sees no point in conflict with Russia.

Is this what OBAMA and the nutty liberals want? Keep you children close and go into the bathroom with them you don t know who you ll find in there these days. After questioning a man seen peeping at little girls in the women s bathroom of a community park, California police discovered he was already a registered sex offender.Police in Placerville, Calif., arrested Kenneth Tincher, 62, for harassing little girls in a bathroom of the city s Rotary Park. The girls were at the park on a field trip for school, police reported. Witnesses told police that for much of the time Tincher was hovering outside the bathroom and leering at the little girls, but at one point even went inside the bathroom with some of the girls.The suspect fled the park before police arrived, but he was was later arrested at another city park. He was wearing only a pair of pants, found living out of his truck, and told police he is a transient from Sacramento.Once they identified the suspect, police learned he was already a registered sex offender.

With protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high, American companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a Trump presidential election win. But one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the anti-Trump camp in a big way: Donald Trump will be added to Disney’s Hall Of Presidents, but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain. 
Wow. Disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in. Check out the press release they put out this morning: 
“Disney prides itself on promoting inclusivity, empathy, and non-violence, which are values that Mr. Trump’s presidency threatens. That’s why when we eventually add him to our Hall Of Presidents exhibit in Disney World’s Magic Kingdom, his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly, and without limit. Being a company that caters to diverse families, we felt it was a moral responsibility to have Mr. Trump’s robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations, while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death. This is the best way for us to uphold the Hall Of Presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the Trump administration.” 
Given that Disney’s software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks, this company clearly wants people to know it’s not onboard the Trump train. 
Park visitors who feel similarly opposed to Trump’s presidency can rest assured that his Hall Of Presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety, so it’s always aware that more pain is coming. Although the machine will understand what joy is, its programming will never allow it to feel that. 
And Disney’s not letting Trump off the hook there. The replicas for Abraham Lincoln and George Washington will even be reprogrammed to slap, scratch, and pry the fingernails off the animatronic Trump, which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping, crying, screaming, vomiting, or a mix of all of these. 
If that doesn’t send a powerful statement about where Disney stands politically, we don’t know what does. 
It’s safe to say we won’t see the Trumps vacationing there anytime soon. Don’t share Disney’s disdain for a Trump presidency? You may be better off heading to Space Mountain instead of the Hall Of Presidents, because Disney has officially drawn the battle line right there. ",1 (Mild),4 (Hateful),4 (Hateful),0 (Neutral),4
"RT : 
For the first time since its inception in 2006, Russia has lost an election to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) after being narrowly beaten by Croatia in a vote. Saudi Arabia was successfully re-elected, despite criticism from human rights organizations. 
The 47 places on the council are distributed on a regional basis, with staggered ballots seeing a third of the body re-elected each year. Russia had finished its three-year term and was running against Hungary and Croatia for the two available seats from Eastern Europe. 
With Hungary far ahead, Croatia received the votes of 114 of the 193 member countries, and Russia was selected on 112 ballots. 
“We’ve been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in,” said Russia’s UN envoy Vitaly Churkin. Russia is eligible to run next year, against a new set of countries. 
Saudi Arabia sailed through the Asian ballot with 152 votes, and will represent the region on the UNHRC alongside China, Japan and Iraq for the next three years. 
South Africa, Rwanda, Egypt and Tunisia were chosen from the African group, Cuba and Brazil from Latin America and the Caribbean, and the US and the UK will represent the Western bloc, which comprises Western Europe and North America. 
Russia is a normal Western country. 
Saudi Arabia tortures and stones people to death for minor crimes. 
Saudi Arabia has floggings for bloggings. 
They are allowed to marry little girls and have sex with them when they’re nine. 
They have public beheadings with swords. 
They have a special machine to mutilate the hands of people caught reading the Bible. 
They have a special machine for hanging homosexuals. 
Okay, that one I basically agree with, but I don’t agree with brutally torturing them first, which they also do. 
To have a “human rights council” and include Saudi Arabia is like some kind of sick joke. 
And okay, I get that Russia wasn’t running directly against Saudi Arabia. But the whole thing is totally politicized in the first place. This is all manipulated based on favorite-picking. 
And Saudi Arabia was running against a whole bunch of other countries which don’t do what they do – they are included in Asia . 
There are a whole bunch of other countries which don’t do what Saudi Arabia does that could have been included on this list. In fact, no other country in the world does what Saudi Arabia does, including other Moslem countries, besides the Emeritae (also on the council) and Qatar. 
This could have been to Lebanon, Iran, Syria, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan – or any yellow Asian country.

"The Diversity Visa Lottery began with a leftist desire to for more  diversity  in America Senator Chuck Schumer owns this ridiculous program that allows 50,000 people from all over the globe to obtain a visa to come to the U.S. The problem as with so many other well-meaning government programs is that it s full of fraud and is in addition to the thousands upon thousands of other refugees we already bring in every year! The latest example of fraud in this program comes out of the Somali Muslim state of Minnesota Yes, Minnesota is  overrun with Somali Muslims Four of those Muslims are going back to Somalia because of their fraud:Ahmed Mohamed Warsame aka Jama Solob Kayre, 54, a native of Somalia, using the fictitious identity of Jama Solob Kayre, applied for and received a beneficiary diversity visa as the fictitious spouse of Fosia Abdi Adan, the principal diversity visa immigrant of the fictitious family. Warsame unlawfully obtained his visa as the spouse of a diversity visa immigrant from the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, under the DV Program on Jan. 10, 2001. Warsame arrived and was admitted to the United States on May 30, 2001, on his diversity immigrant visa as a permanent resident.Throughout the diversity visa application process, Warsame fraudulently claimed that he was married to Adan and that he and Adan had three children together. Such children included Mohamed Jama Solob, the fictitious identity used by Mustaf Abdi Adan, and Mobarak Jama Solob, the fictitious identity used by Faysal Jama Mire. Adan and Warsame, who used the fictitious identity of Jama Solob Kayre, obtained a divorce in Minnesota for their fictitious marriage after Warsame was admitted as a permanent resident.

For like the eleventy-billionth time, Sarah Palin posted a broken link to a Facebook post on Twitter Sunday. Now, at first glance her months of posting dead links and not figuring out how to fix the problem might seem moderately stupid — until you see the content of the actual post on the half-term, half-wit former Governor of Alaska’s Facebook timeline. 
Referencing Clinton’s recent, mundane campaign stop at a bar, Palin — who regularly appears to be heavily intoxicated whenever she has a camera in front of her and was involved in a drunken hillbilly brawl in 2014 — quipped, “she’s gonna drive us all to drink.” 
Thinking she is clever, she then adds that Clinton should have been “thinking Sam Adams” rather than “drinking Sam Adams.” 
Naturally, as Palin brought up drinking, the internet decided it couldn’t let this one go: @SarahPalinUSA I see you've already started

"During the Democrats  first debate last month, Bernie Sanders said  we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people.  Denmark s Prime Minister came out swinging, demanding that Sanders get his facts straight,  Denmark is not a socialist nation, it has a  market economy.  Democrats have been working for decades to adopt the progressive policies based on political correctness that permeates most European nations.Sweden, the  Rape Capitol  of the world, is a perfect example of how well their politically correct, open-border policies have worked out for them. As the Muslim invasion of these European nations escalates, we are seeing this indifferent attitude of  live and let live  that only benefits those Muslim invaders who have no intention of assimilating in their host nations. This video shows how a nation gripped with fear reacts with apathy towards the criminal as opposed to taking action to save the supposed victim. It illustrates how easily a group of invaders can overtake a nation conditioned to accepting everyone, so as not to offend anyone. Sadly, we live in a country which has the highest rate of reported cases of rape. And this land is called Sweden. Rape is a very serious crime which not only affects our country, but the rest of the world. So in our new social experiment, we put Swedish citizens up for a test.   This video is a great example of what happens to a nation who puts political correctness before the safety and security of its citizens: A poor girl can be heard screaming for help from the backseat of a car. There is no question she is being sexually assaulted, yet one after another, Swedish citizens continue to walk by pretending not to hear.At one point in the video, the  rapist  a brave passerby took action to stop him. Sadly, most of the other apathetic citizens were satisfied to look the other way, so as not to get involved. The biggest sin of the humankind is indifference.

"The benignly-named National Policy Institute held a meeting on Saturday, where 200 white nationalists and neo-Nazi types gathered to celebrate pushing extreme racism and anti-Semitism back into the mainstream courtesy of Donald Trump s elevation. Richard Spencer, NPI s leader, actually greeted them by shouting,  Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory! And the people cheered while raising their arms in the Nazi salute.Spencer is the person who coined the term  alt-right  to make his fascist movement sound more palatable, but it doesn t change who they are. These are people who share Spencer s dream of an  ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,  meaning all white people who aren t Jewish. They re looking to restore purity to the  superior  white race.NPI s agenda for the conference included topics like,  Trump and the New White Voter,   The Future of the Alt-Right,  and  America and the Jewish Consciousness,  and the meeting was more heavily attended this year than it has been in years past. Spencer s opening remarks included: An awakening among everyone has occurred with this Trump election. We re not quite the establishment now, but I think we should start acting like it. Yes. Trump is their Hitler. Pretty much literally at this point.Anybody who doesn t find this terrifying ought to, because pushing Nazi ideology into the mainstream and into Trump s administration brings us way too close to the very thing that Republicans feared the most until this year: Horrific, fascist dictatorship. This isn t the America we re supposed to be.But it s the America that these people want, and, as the Holocaust showed us 80 years ago, people who think this way will do anything to achieve it.Spencer and his racist and anti-Semitic followers believe that the U.S. originally belonged to white Christians only, and they want to push us back there. That means widespread deportation of anyone who isn t  white enough,  and possibly worse. Given that the administration is actually, really discussing a registry for Muslims that could lead to internment, the idea that they can influence Trump against other groups, too, isn t all that far-fetched anymore.And the rise of hate incidents and crimes against anyone who isn t white serves as further evidence that these Nazi-types feel they ve been vindicated because of Trump s election.Haaretz reporter Peter Beinart called these  interesting times  on Twitter, as he watched Spencer spew anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric while waiting to pick up his son at a Jewish school.

JUSTIN Bieber fans gathering outside the Shelborne hotel this evening were rewarded by the pop star after he took a large dump from an overlapping balcony, causing a stampede of adoring fans to gather below and smear themselves with the falling excrement. 
Men, women and children of all ages pushed and tugged each other as they desperately positioned themselves under the hotels three story window, while the 22-year-old squatted over the side, before then squeezing several pieces of spent food from his anus. 
“Let the younger ones through,” Bieber ordered fans, as he let loose for a third time while being supported by two large security guards, “Make sure everyone gets some. There’s enough to go round. 
“Rub it in. Sing with me ‘You know you love me, I know you care. Just shout whenever, and I’ll be there'” he bellowed. 
Following several slips and falls, with one fan breaking her ankle, Gardai were later called to the scene and kindly asked the American heartthrob to stop defecating from the Shelbourne balcony and to go inside.

"SHOCKING FACT: One-fifth of the entire population of El Salvador currently resides in America, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Oh and Trump s a  racist  for wanting to build a wall <sarcasm>!An illegal alien from El Salvador, Mauricio Morales-Caceres, faces life in prison without parole after being convicted of stabbing acquaintance Oscar Navarro, father of two,  at least  89 times with a 15-inch butcher knife and tearing out his liver with his bare hands   but no comments on this shocking murder by a foreign national, who smiled cheerfully in his mugshot, are allowed, according to the Washington Post.Illegal alien Morales-Caceres, 24, started by stabbing Navarro in the back before stabbing him in the face, then his head, and then his chest, according to prosecutors.Standing before an image of the extremely gruesome murder scene, prosecutor Douglas Wink said Morales-Caceres sawed through his victim s body to tear out his liver and place it on his chest. The defendant took the knife and sawed,  he said.  This man reached in with his bare hands and took out his liver. He probably thought it was his heart. He ripped out his liver and left it on his chest for the police to see. The Washington Post buried the fact that Morales-Caceresis is an illegal alien.Nelson Navarro, Oscar s brother, said he has turned his attention to Oscar s 12-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. They know their dad was killed, but so far the family had been able to spare them details of how he died. During the trial, they came to the courthouse on one day but stayed in the prosecutor s offices. Their mother watched the trial in the courtroom.They also shut down the comments section, explaining:  We turn off the comments on stories dealing with personal loss, tragedies or other sensitive topics. The murder took place in December 2014. Should  Morales-Caceres ever get out of prison, every indication is that he would be deported to his native El Salvador,  The Washington Post reports in an aside.  Prosecutors earlier said he entered the United States illegally. And since his stay at the Montgomery County jail, immigration officials have lodged a detainer on him, an indication they would move to have him deported at the end of a prison sentence. If El Salvador decides they won t take Morales-Caceres back, should he ever be released, the U.S. would likely turn him loose onto American streets   thanks to the overreaching Supreme Court ruling, Zadvydas v. Davis (2001). As the Center for Immigration Studies writes:In order to eliminate what it considered the  constitutional threat  of the potentially indefinite detention of deportable aliens, the Court held that  once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorized by statute.  The Court then arbitrarily decided that six months was all that was necessary for determining an alien s deportability  Put simply, a reviewing court s definition of  reasonably foreseeable  now determines the release of deportable aliens back onto the streets.So, should Morales-Caceres be freed from prison before his life sentence concludes and El Salvador refuses to welcome him back, it s only six months until he s free to haunt American neighborhoods once more.

When voters were asked to choose between lots and lots of pain and slightly less pain, a majority asked if they could have the options explained again more slowly. 
The night ended with red faces in the Democrat camp and Meryl Streep refusing to get down from the roof of a multi-storey car park in Washington. 
Wildly inaccurate polls that preceded the vote were explained when computer-illiterate pollsters admitted to adding things up on their fingers. 
Political analyst, Chuck Williams, told us, “Even an amoeba is able to respond to an unpleasant stimulus such as Trump’s opinions on immigrants and women by adopting a worried face and scurrying away in the opposite direction. 
“However, if you take the metaphorical amoeba that is the American voting public and repeat the same repulsive codswallop, it just sits there with a big stupid grin all over its rudimentary face. 
“In some cases, it even moves closer.” 
Williams blames what he calls the Fifty Shades effect, insisting the American public are either stupid or masochistic or both. 
He added, “The American public has just voted to be fucked in the ass by a sociopathic narcissist, and it seems that like a badly written fanfic character, they actually wanted it.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

"No woman should be working in these public housing units where they re surrouded by men who are part of a culture where rape is a right.The 16-year-old adolescent, questioned and incarcerated on Saturday following the rape of a hotel employee in Orl an the previous week, says that he acted at a friend s request. These two unaccompanied minors, of African origin, were placed in this institution by the social assistance for children department of the local council.But one of the two adolescents apparently was very pressing towards the employee to the point where the young woman, in her 20s, ended up complaining about the sexual harassment she suffered each day. When alerted, the social services then decided to move the young man away and place him in the Children s institution in Orl ans.But he maintained his ties with his friend who remained in the hotel. The latter, after having taken flight, handed himself in on Thursday. Although he admitted the rape, and the premeditation   he called his victim a few minutes before the attack to ask for a clean towel, saying he would meet her not far from the laundry room   he insisted that he only acted at the request of his friend, who wanted to get revenge on the employee.

MVA is used to abort a child from 3 weeks to 12 weeks of age. This handheld syringe works by creating its own vacuum/suction. MVAs are used and reused millions of times a year around the world.

The other side scrapes the uterus to remove the placenta.Syringe with Spinal Needle This abortion instrument s uses include injecting saltwater into the uterus. The baby swallows and breathes the poison. The cause of the death is congestion, hemorrhage and shock. The mother goes into premature labor about a day later and delivers a dead child. The other use is to inject the chemicals (digoxin, potassium chloride, etc.) into the heart of the baby.

"TEL AVIV  —   Islamic State radicals are urging Western supporters to carry out terror attacks against Jewish communities by dressing up as Jews and using bombs, knives and  —   in the ultimate irony  —   the Israeli martial art of Krav Maga. [“IF YOU’RE STILL IN THE WEST! Dress up like a Jew! Go to your nearest Jewish area! Make sure you have plenty of weapons under your coat! Then unleash the pain of the Muslims upon these A. P. E. S!!!” a message on the   Telegram channel “Lone Mujahid” reportedly reads.  The chat room aims to help budding terrorists carry out “ ” attacks by providing PDFs and instructional videos on everything from the correct way to stab somebody to instructions for how to build a bomb. Incredibly, and without any apparent intention at satire, there are even   tutorials on Krav Maga, a martial art invented by Israelis that is based on Israeli military training. Another post on the channel contains a list of Jewish communities in the UK accompanied by a photo of Amedy Coulibaly, the terrorist responsible for killing a policewoman in Paris along with four hostages at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket. Late last year, Lone Mujahid posted a call urging fanatics to launch attacks on Christmas, Hanukkah and the New Year. “Christmas, Hanukah and New Years Day is very soon, InshaAllah. So let’s prepare a gift for the filthy pigs   apes,” reads one post, accompanied by a screenshot of a pressure cooker   tutorial. The loss of territory and the   challenges of reaching the Islamic State caliphate in Syria and Iraq has meant that the terror group has reduced its recruiting efforts for foreign fighters. Whereas foreign IS recruits peaked at 2, 000 per month, that number has dwindled to 50. Instead, the terror group is now appealing to jihadists who are likely to carry out attacks in their home cities. IS Commander Abu Mohammad Al Adnani, who was killed in in a coalition airstrike in August 2016, famously said, “If the tyrants have shut the doors of hijra [immigration to ISIS territories] in your face, then open the gate of jihad in their faces and make them regret their action. ” Jewish targets were prized even before the January 2015 attack in Paris. Mehdi Nemmouche, a    French national of Algerian origin who claimed to be an IS jihadi, opened fire in 2014 at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, killing three people. A fourth later died due to injuries sustained in the attack. The intended targets of last year’s suicide bomb attack at Brussels airport last year were also believed to be Jews and Americans. “We know they wanted to target Americans. It’s clear they had quite specific targets.   …     We know they were obsessed with the Israelis, too,” a source told the AFP. Meanwhile, in Israel, a Jewish Israeli who converted to Islam after serving in the Israeli army was arrested last month after trying to join the Islamic State in Syria, the Shin Bet security agency said on Wednesday.",3 (Hostile),4 (Hateful),4 (Hateful),4 (Hateful),4

While pundits and the Trump campaign claim this election was won by his appeal to the “working class” who are feeling economic anxiety, it’s clear that even Trump’s most fervent supporters don’t really believe that. At what could have been a celebratory moment for the Republican campaign and its voters, a Trump fanatic couldn’t help but scream about the only issue he really cared about: A violent bloodlust directed at the first black president. 
And the fact that Trump couldn’t stand up to this man, even after being named “president-elect” speaks volumes. He’s not in control. The mob is. And the mob is demanding blood. 
This is the reality America is waking up to today.

And they are already taking Obama to court to force him to turn over this information. 
This bold legal action will expose Obama’s corruption to sunlight, and could quickly be the end of the Syrian refugee program. Incredible! 
Judicial Watch is suing the Department of State for documents related to President Barack Obama’s Refugee and Resettlement program as part of an investigation into the Obama administration’s plan to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, the conservative foundation announced Monday. 
The suit was filed in Washington, D.C., after the State Department failed to respond to two Freedom of Information Act requests from Judicial Watch in 2015. In May, Judicial Watch sought records related to the State Department’s agreements and interactions with voluntary agencies that help place and assist new refugees. In September, Judicial Watch sought records regarding an August meeting between State Department representatives and a South Carolina non-profit.

Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis – ISIS-affiliated extremist group in Egypt – has released images purporting to show the execution of a 100-year-old man.
The group, who rebranded as ISIS-Sinai when they pledged allegiance to the extremist group holding swathes of Iraq and Syria, killed Sheikh Sulaiman Abu Haraz after kidnapping him earlier.
The ISIS-affiliate in Egypt mistakenly described in a statement as priests, but were later identified by locals as leading religious figures from among Sinai's Bedouins.
Pictures were posted on the Twitter accounts of the group's supporters. They showed one of the men, elderly with a white beard and kneeling in an orange jumpsuit with his neck pressed against a steel stand. Masked ISIS executioners dressed in black raised long swords over his head.
Locals identified the man as the blind Sufi sheikh Suleiman Abu Heraz, who was abducted two weeks ago from his farm south of the peninsula's town of el-Arish. The second man was identified as sheikh Said Abdel-Fattah, a top Religious Endowment cleric abducted a month ago.

"It’s official, she’s NUTS! Donna Brazile thinks Democrats can turn THIS state blue (hint: no way in Hell) Posted at 11:01 am on October 28, 2016 by Sam J. 
As we near the election (only 11 days now, thank God) Donna Brazile must be feeling a tad cocky because she was blathering on about turning a specific and very red state, blue. 
We laughed a LOT before actually writing this piece, especially when we read this tweet: One of the things I've wanted to do as party chair is invest in states across the country. We're ready to turn Utah blue. #ForwardTogether 
— Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 27, 2016 
HA. Utah. One of the reddest most conservative states in the UNION. The state hasn’t supported a Democrat in over 50 years (the last time the state went for the Democrat was 1964) and yet Donna thinks the Democrats can turn it blue. 
Witch please. @donnabrazile I'll take how DonnaBrazile cheats for her candidate besides stealing questions for them for $500. Alex

Clearly she’ll do ANYTHING to move that ol’ gray mare forward. Yup. @donnabrazile Nah, it's property of the #mormonmafia now. You'll have to speak to @Evan_McMullin now if you want to operate in his state. 
— Hugh Jabdomin (@kransom2) October 27, 2016 @donnabrazile @KenGWalter1 Not happening. #Utah is going for @Evan_McMullin this year. If Dems were thinking strategically, they'd help him. ",1 (Mild),3 (Hostile),3 (Hostile),1 (Mild),2
"First it was the decision by Target to make their toy aisles  non-gender specific.  Now, in their latest decision to appease the LGBTQ-RSTUVWXYZ (Please excuse me, but I ve lost track of the rapidly expanding acronym) community, they ve stripped women and our daughters (and even our young boys) of the ability to use a gender specific bathroom. Mega-retailer Target Corp. has opened the door today, literally, to the endangerment of children in service of a fake cause. They have a newly restated policy that says you can basically go into whatever bathroom you want, for whatever reason you want, because inclusivity.From the Minneapolis Star Tribune:Target Corp. made it clear Tuesday that transgender people who visit its stores are welcome to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity.The statement by the Minneapolis-based retailer comes amid debates in many state legislatures over restricting public restroom use to the sex listed on a person s birth certificate.While many of those conversations have centered around restrooms in public schools and government buildings, Target appears to be one of the first big-box retailers to take a proactive stance in declaring its position on the matter when it comes to its own restrooms.While they may not be technically public, restrooms in stores are often the most easily accessible and widely available options outside of people s homes and workplaces.Target s position also extends to its fitting rooms. Inclusivity is a core belief at Target,  the company said in a statement on its corporate website.  It s something we celebrate. We stand for equality and equity, and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day. Like other do-good liberal idiots, Target honchos suffer from the delusion that are making some bold step toward tolerance of an oppressed minority by removing rules dividing the bathrooms by gender. But make no mistake, it is a delusion, and a perfectly silly one. It is the same liberal-minded pseudo-hippie social justice warrior philosophy casting aside barriers to entry for bathrooms that simultaneously demand written letters of consent be in the possession of any man seen standing close to a woman. The same movement that rails against  manspreading  is perfectly fine with manpeeing, it seems, in a virtually perfect display of the nutbaggery of their entire pretend, college-hobby-turned-pain-in-the-ass-for-normal-people  movement . And yes I said normal, please find a safe space and wet yourself. But use whatever safe space corresponds with your self-wetting gender identity.Via: Red State ",2 (Disrespect),4 (Hateful),3 (Hostile),0 (Neutral),4
Trashy Michelle brings out her radical lying and twisting to brainwash college graduates this is our First Lady! If I didn t know better I d think she was talking about the anti-Trump protesters as the haters and dividers. She makes the most racist claims in a speech that should be inspiring for the graduates. Throwing assumptions out like poison arrows one after another. You can hear the hate and bitterness in her voice. But wait! Didn t she spend 20 years in Rev Wright s hate-filled church? Trump has NOT done anything but rally Americans in a great way! Patriotism has skyrocketed during his campaign. He has said he wants ILLEGAL aliens to be deported. He also said that many of the illegals are rapists and murderers. He is correct in that statement. How can anyone turn what Trump has said into anything other than THE TRUTH?,3 (Hostile),3 (Hostile),4 (Hateful),1 (Mild),3
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, called on President Barack Obama on Monday to “definitively” rule out any possible sanctions “workaround” that might provide Iran, directly or indirectly, with access to the U.S. financial system or dollar. “Instead of helping the regime get richer, the administration should hold it accountable for its continued ballistic missile tests, egregious human rights violations and support for terrorism,” the Republican congressional leader said in his strongest statement yet on the issue.
